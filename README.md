# Jeopardy Search Engine
A web application that allows the user to search through every Jeopardy question. Filters such as category, date (including, year, month, week, and day) and difficulty can be selected to narrow the search. Searches are returned in pages which return matching searches from 1000 categories at a time to improve runtime and user experience. Further information about searching can be found at the application home page.
